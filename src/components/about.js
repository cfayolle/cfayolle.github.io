          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>After completing college, I spent a year in Nashville working as a research assistant and composing/producing music during my free time. As my interest in medicine began to decline, I stumbled upon programming and quickly fell in love with the intricacies of creatively solving technical problems.</p>
